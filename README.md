# UT Raccoon, aka poostorm
This was an iOS application designed and developed in XCode using Swift and SwiftUI. 
Made by me (Jinni) for my iOS Programming course at school. 

## Basic Functionalities
*Goal: Creating an application where a user can create an account, login, and make posts that give info on free things around college campus.*
1. Google Firebase: User account info
2. Google Firestore: Post info, associated with users
3. Camera (AVFoundation): Take user photo and post photo
4. MapKit & CoreLocation: Get current coordinates for post, display current location (asks for permission), display pins for location of other posts in database
5. CoreData: Store user data
6. Multithreading: To continuously update location, get user info asyncronously
